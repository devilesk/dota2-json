# dota2-json

Dota 2 game data parsed to json used in my dota 2 projects.

I wouldn't recommend starting a new project based off this repo,
because I rarely update this and some data is arbitrarily filtered out and keys renamed according to my own needs.

Dotabuff automatically parses the Dota VPK to json and it's much better so use that.
